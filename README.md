| **1. Research of advertisements of apartments for sale** 🔗[Project_Advertisements](Project_Advertisements.ipynb)|We have at our disposal data from the Yandex.Real Estate service \\ - an archive of advertisements for apartments for sale in St. Petersburg and neighboring cities for several years. Let's determine the market value of real estate objects. Our task is to set the parameters. This will allow you to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity. | **pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy**|
| **2. Analysis and prediction of computer games' sales** 🔗[Project_Computer_Games](Project_Computer_Games.ipynb) | We are going to analyze and predict the sales of an online computer game store based on data up to 2016. In the dataset comes the acronym ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), which is an association that determines the age rating of computer games. The ESRB rates game content and assigns it an appropriate age category, such as "For Adults," "For Young Children," or "For Teens." | **pandas, numpy, plotly.graph_objects**|
| **3. Selecting a location for the oil well** 🔗[Project_Oil_Well](Project_Oil_Well.ipynb) | We are given oil samples from three regions: each has 10,000 fields where we have measured the quality of the oil and the amount of oil reserves. Let's build a machine learning model that will help us identify the region where production will bring the highest profit. We'll analyze the possible profits and risks using Bootstrap techniques. | **pandas, numpy, sklearn** |
